For this project to be opened and compiled in Visual Studio 2013 you will need to download the FBX Loader and the
Cutdown PhysX SDK. The Cutdown PhysX SDK will need to be renamed "Physx" and the FBX Loader should be named "FBXLoader".

Both of these folders need to be placed in the "dep" folder in the solution directory.
